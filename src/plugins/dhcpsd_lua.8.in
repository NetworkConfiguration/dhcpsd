.Sh NAME
.Nm lua
.Nd lookup IP address and configure DHCP options using Lua
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
will load
.Pa @CONFDIR@/dhcp.lua .
It should define the function
.Fn configure_pools.
It could also define the functions
.Fn lookup_hostname ,
.Fn lookup_ip_address
and
.Fn add_dhcp_options .
.Pp
You could define the function
.Fn commit_lease
which is called each time a DHCP lease is committed in various states.
You could use this function to maintain a DNS server for the IP address
leased.
It is recommended you pay attention to the flags as you don't want to
insert an OFFERED ip address into DNS for example.
.Pp
If you define
.Fn commit_lease ,
the you should also define the function
.Fn expire_lease .
.Pp
All these functions are optional, and if undefined OR return a nil or zero
value then
.Nm dhcpsd
will proceed to the next plugin.
.Pp
A table called dhcp is provided which exposes some functions to query the
incoming DHCP message and manipulate the outgoing DHCP reply.
For
.Fn expire_lease
you cannot query any DHCP message as there is none, just the lease.
