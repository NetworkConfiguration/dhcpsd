.Sh NAME
.Nm ethers
.Nd lookup IP addresses from the
.Xr ethers 5
database.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
will lookup a line in
.Xr ethers 5 ,
matching the ethernet address to the
.Dv chaddr
field in the DHCP message for messages with have a
.Dv htype
of
.Sy 1
and a
.Dv hlen
of
.Sy 6 .
.Pp
If the matched line does not have an IP address
then it is assumed to be a hostname and is looked up using
.Xr getaddrinfo 3
and the first IP address returned is the one used.
.Pp
If the client asks for a hostname in the parameter request list option
and we have matched a hostname to the ethernet address then the
hostname is added to the DHCP reply for OFFER and ACK messages.
.Pp
Any IP address returned overrides any that the client requested.
