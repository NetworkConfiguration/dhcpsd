.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcpsd
.Nd a DHCP server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl df
.Op Fl p Ar plugin
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an implementation of the DHCP server specified in
.Li RFC 2131 .
.Pp
.Nm
relies entirely on plugins for configuration.
The man page for each plugin is prefixed with
.Sy dhcpsd- .
If no plugins are specified, then the
.Sy auto
and
.Sy leasefile
plugins are loaded.
.Pp
Plugins operate on a first one wins scenario,
so the order of plugins given is important if you load more than
one which does the same job.
.Pp
Options are :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl d
Enable debug diagnostics.
.It Fl f
Run in the foreground.
Useful when debugging.
Messages will be printed to
.Xr stderr 4
rather than
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Fl p Ar plugin
Loads the named
.Ar plugin .
If
.Ar plugin
contains a
.Pa /
character then it is treated as a full path.
Otherwise,
.Pa .so
is appended and it is loaded from the plugin directory
.Pa @PLUGINDIR@ .
You may use the
.Fl p
option as many times as you have plugins.
.El
.Sh NOTES
.Nm
requires a Berkeley Packet Filter, or BPF device on BSD based systems and a
Linux Socket Filter, or LPF device on Linux based systems for all IPv4
configuration.
